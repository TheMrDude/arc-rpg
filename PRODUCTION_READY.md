# 🚀 ARC RPG - PRODUCTION READY

All premium features are now fully functional and ready for launch!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Unified Authentication System**
Created `lib/api-auth.js` with centralized auth handling:
- **authenticateRequest()**: Accepts both Bearer tokens (from localStorage) AND cookies (SSR)
- **checkPremiumStatus()**: Single source of truth for premium verification
- All APIs now use this unified system

### 2. **Database Schema Alignment**
- Removed ALL references to non-existent `is_premium` column
- All code now uses `subscription_status === 'active'`
- Fixed profile queries to only select columns that exist

### 3. **Complete API Overhaul**
- **/api/recurring-templates**: Clean rewrite, all CRUD methods working (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **/api/transform-quest**: Fixed premium checks
- **/api/weekly-summary**: Fixed premium checks
- All APIs handle Authorization headers properly

### 4. **Frontend Premium Pages**
- **Templates** (`/templates`): Create, edit, delete, toggle templates ✅
- **Equipment** (`/equipment`): View, unlock, equip gear ✅
- **Skills** (`/skills`): Unlock skills with skill points ✅
- **Dashboard**: Premium badge, feature cards, upgrade prompts ✅

### 5. **Premium Features Working**
- ✅ Recurring quest templates (daily, weekly, custom schedules)
- ✅ Equipment system (12 starter items, XP multipliers)
- ✅ Skill trees (4 trees: Power, Wisdom, Efficiency, Fortune)
- ✅ AI Dungeon Master (enhanced narration with story context)
- ✅ Weekly summaries (epic AI-generated recaps)
- ✅ Story progress tracking
